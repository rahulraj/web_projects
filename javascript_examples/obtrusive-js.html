<!-- this works
<span onclick="click()">click here</span>
-->

<!-- what follows in non-commented code fails, but renaming to click_dnj works

To see what's going on, replace by the following and see that click is bound to native code:
<input onclick="console.log(click)"></input>

Or try this, to display attribute and see that listener string is executed in context of this element:
<input id="x" onclick="console.log(getAttribute('id'))"></input>

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element#Methods
click is bound in this context! simulates click on element

-->
<input id="x" onclick="click()"></input>
