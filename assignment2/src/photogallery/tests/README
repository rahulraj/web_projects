This directory contains tests for the photogallery assignment.

Note that simply running "python foo_test.py" won't work! The reason
for this is because the code uses relative imports to access modules
from other parts of photogallery. If you run the file directly, __name__
will become bound to '__main__' and the relative imports will fail.

Instead, from assignment2/src, run
"python -m photogallery.tests.foo_test.py".
This should handle relative imports properly.

Alternatively, if you have nosetests installed, you can run it from
assignment2/, assignment2/src/, assignment2/src/photogallery/, or
assignment2/src/photogallery/tests/ and its test runner should do the 
right thing.
