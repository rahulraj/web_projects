6.170 Assignments
=================

The code in this repository was originally written for 6.170,
(also referred to as 6.S197 or 6.S183 in Fall 2011) Software
Studio. The class was taught by Prof. Daniel Jackson, and
covered software engineering best practices. There were several
substantial coding assignments, as well as a group final project
(not in this repository). All of the assignments were done
individually.

Assignment 1 - Object Models
----------------------------
This assignment did not require writiting code. I was asked
to draw object models for several scenarios. The goal was to
  *   Practice planning out software architecture before implementing
      it
  *   Familiarize myself with the OM notation that the class used
      *   It drew inspiration from Alloy, UML, among others, but was
          simplified compared to them
  *   Practice expressing ideas in writeups
